AI-powered, invisible CAPTCHA for WordPress forms – login, registration, WooCommerce, and more. Block bots without annoying your users.

== Description ==

**Smarter Security. Better Experience.**  
AI Captcha is a lightweight WordPress plugin that integrates with [aicaptcha.site](https://aicaptcha.site) to provide intelligent, AI-driven CAPTCHA protection. It works silently in the background across all your site’s key forms — including login, registration, password reset, and WooCommerce — to stop bots in their tracks without disrupting real users.

**Highlights:**
- Invisible CAPTCHA – no puzzles or checkboxes.
- Works with native WP and WooCommerce forms.
- Simple settings page for API setup.
- Free and open-source.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-aiCaptcha` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugin screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Go to **Settings > AI Captcha** and enter your API key from [aicaptcha.site](https://aicaptcha.site).
4. Save changes. CAPTCHA will now be applied automatically.
